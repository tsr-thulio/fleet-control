# Fleet-control

App for control of car fleets

This app is a single page application very simple to manage vehicle fleets. The data managed in the app are stored in memory because the whole challange was about the frontend skills, because of that all changes made in the app will be lost when the page refreshes. 


# Executing the application

To run locally, using gulp, follow the steps after opening terminal:

- Clone this repository.
- Make sure you have NodeJS and Gulp (npm install -g gulp) installed on your machine. I used version 6x and 3x respectively.
- Run npm install to get all dependencies like AngularJS, Angular Material and so many others.
- Run gulp. A web browser window/tab should be opened with a localhost. (Preferably, Chrome)

Enjoy.
